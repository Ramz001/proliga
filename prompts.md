Develop the UI for a mobile fantasy football mobile application, focusing on a user-friendly and engaging experience. The application should feature a 'Tours' section, allowing users to navigate between different fantasy football tours. This section should display the currently selected tour and provide intuitive controls (e.g., buttons) to move to the next or previous tours. The application must incorporate a tab-based navigation system to switch between various modes of operation. These modes include:

Team Profile: This tab should present a visual representation of the user's team within a stadium setting. Include a small card displaying essential team information, such as the team's name, unique identifier (ID), current tour points, the start and end dates of the current tour, and the total points accumulated to date.

Transfer: The transfer mode should facilitate player management. Initially, it should present a table that allows users to select, delete, filter, and search for players. Following player selection, the UI should transition to a visual representation of the user's team, displayed as a stadium or field layout, with the 11 selected players positioned accordingly. Each player should be labeled with their name. Include interactive elements such as buttons for initiating player transfers, accessing detailed player information, and removing players from the team. The availability of these buttons should dynamically adjust based on the current tab and user interactions.

Statistics: This section should provide comprehensive statistical data. It should include a leaderboard table showcasing the top-performing players and teams, allowing users to analyze performance metrics and standings.

Ensure the UI is designed with mobile usability in mind, including responsive design principles for various screen sizes and orientations. The design should be visually appealing and intuitive, enhancing the overall user experience.

The application should be built using React Native and Expo.

The application should be built using the latest version of React Native and Expo.
